QuizMaster CLI

QuizMaster CLI is a command-line quiz application built with Python, SQLAlchemy, and SQLite as part of a Phase 3 school project. The application allows users to select a quiz category such as Python, SQL, or OOP, answer questions one by one, and see their score immediately at the end of the quiz. Each attempt is stored in a database so users can track their progress over time. The project demonstrates object-oriented programming principles using three main models: Category, Question, and QuizAttempt. Database management and migrations are handled with SQLAlchemy and Alembic, while dependencies are managed through Pipenv to ensure a consistent development environment. The CLI runs entirely in the terminal, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience. To use the application, first install dependencies with pipenv install and enter the environment with pipenv shell, then run database migrations with alembic upgrade head, seed the database with python -m lib.db.seed, and start the quiz using python -m lib.cli. Future improvements could include adding user accounts, more quiz questions, difficulty levels, or a graphical interface for easier interaction.
